Fund Management Policy and SOPs - Expert’s Review
Introduction
This document is a comprehensive operational guide for an entity responsible for executing fund management processes in the finance domain. It defines roles with explicit permissions (Cans) and restrictions (Cannots) to ensure secure, compliant, and efficient operations. All Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are designed for single‑turn execution, meaning each procedure is self‑contained and completed in one interaction. Each SOP provides clear steps for proceeding when conditions are met, and explicit halt instructions with error reporting when conditions are not met. The framework emphasizes compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., AML/KYC, SEC guidelines), risk mitigation, and auditability. If any external integration (e.g., database or API) fails, the entity must halt and notify the appropriate role.
All amounts/currencies are in USD and all policies applied are United States based.


Entities
Liabilities
Liabilities are the fees (management or purchasing or commission or regulatory fees) that the investor is paying to purchase the instrument.
All liabilities are calculated by 1.5% of the closing price of the instrument.
Future Value of an Asset
This is the forecasted value of a fund. It can be calculated by the closing price of the fund or NAV multiplied by the (1 + r)^n. 
Where r = growth rate and n = number of years.

Portfolio Holdings
One investor is only allowed to have one portfolio, while one portfolio can have multiple portfolio holdings. Each portfolio holding can have only one fund attached to it.
